🌱 CLEOVENT

Digital Twin for CO₂ Capture in Urban Settings

📌 Problem Statement

Urban areas face increasing CO₂ emissions from transportation, buildings, and industrial activities. Existing systems lack real-time, zone-level simulation and decision support for planning carbon capture interventions.

SIH Problem Statement ID: SIH25222
Theme: Clean & Green Technology

💡 Proposed Solution

CLEOVENT is a Digital Twin–based urban CO₂ simulation platform that models emissions, dispersion, and capture strategies in real time to support data-driven urban climate decisions.

The system enables planners and policymakers to

Simulate CO₂ emissions across city zones

Analyze dispersion based on wind, terrain, and traffic

Test carbon capture technologies virtually

Predict air quality and emission reduction outcomes

🚀 Key Features

Urban CO₂ Emission Simulation
Models emissions from transport, buildings, and industry.

Dispersion Modeling
Simulates pollutant spread using airflow and atmospheric logic.

Carbon Capture Scenario Testing
Evaluates green walls, biofilters, and Direct Air Capture (DAC).

Real-Time Digital Twin Concept
Combines simulated data with real-world datasets.

What-if Scenario Planning
Enables policy testing before real-world deployment.
